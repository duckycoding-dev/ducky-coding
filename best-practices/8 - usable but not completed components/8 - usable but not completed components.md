### Fast progress for a working result

In order to progress the development at a decent speed to achieve a usable product, we might need to create some components without covering every scenario: this will most likely happen talking about styles, like variants for sizes, colors, etc,...

To keep track of "usable components that are not yet completed" we will write a component at the end of the files like this: `{/* USABLE BUT NOT COMPLETED */}`\
This it will be easy to find components to complete later on, just by searching for that sentece globally
